This script goes along the blog post
"Building powerful image classification models using very little data"
from blog.keras.io.
It uses data that can be downloaded at:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
In our setup, we:
- created a data/ folder
- created train/ and validation/ subfolders inside data/
- created cats/ and dogs/ subfolders inside train/ and validation/
- put the cat pictures index 0-999 in data/train/cats
- put the cat pictures index 1000-1400 in data/validation/cats
- put the dogs pictures index 12500-13499 in data/train/dogs
- put the dog pictures index 13500-13900 in data/validation/dogs
So that we have 1000 training examples for each class, and 400 validation examples for each class.
In summary, this is our directory structure:
```

            dog002.jpg
